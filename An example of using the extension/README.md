# Kotlin
The random() extension was created. In Extensions.kt provides examples of using extensions. In The Tavern.kt imported the random() extension and rewritten the toDragonSpeak() function as an extension function. To the Player.kt class added the random extension and renamed (as randomizer) it in this file.
